                In the past two years, I{`&apos;`}ve dedicated myself to honing
                my web development skills and expanding my knowledge base.
                During this time, I{`&apos;`}ve acquired a diverse set of skills
                that have enabled me to excel in various aspects of web
                development.

                My focus has been on achieving excellence in every facet of web
                development. I{`&apos;`}ve delved deep into front-end
                development, ensuring that I can create visually appealing and
                user-friendly websites. My proficiency extends to HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript, as well as modern libraries and frameworks like
                React and Vue.js. Responsive design principles have become
                second nature, ensuring that the websites I build are accessible
                and adaptive across all devices.
